# Toast Notification in Windows 10
Toast Notification in Windows 10 using win10toast

This is just a random script I wrote to remind me to eat my meals during the working hours.

## Initial steps

Change the directory to where the script is stored in `toastNotifyForMeals.bat`

## How this works
Run the `toastNotifyForMeals.vbs` for executing the script. 

## Issues
Having issues with the `toastNotifyForMeals.bat` file as it will not close during the script execution so I wrote a vb script to workaround that issue.

Still work in progress :)
